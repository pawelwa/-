            I’m a Designer based in Poland, specializing in Product Design, Research,
            and Interaction Design. In short, I help people
            build companies, develop brands and digital products with a focus on
            simplicity and scalability.
            <br><br>
            I am currently working at <a href="https://www.letsdeel.com">Deel</a> as a Senior Product Designer in Payments team.
            <br><br>
            Previously, I worked at <a href="https://www.revolut.com">Revolut</a> for two years, where I was a responsible for
            Core Products such as: Accounts, Transactions, Cards and Vaults. I helped scale the Product
            from 3 million to over 12 million users and worked with pretty much every team in the company,
            including Revolut for Business. Before I left, Revolut raised <a href="#">$500 million</a>
            in Series D, which made it one of the most valuable fintech startups in the world.
            <br><br>
            In my spare time I enjoy learning new things, so I like reading
           books, listening to music & podcasts, and spending hours
            reading articles & finding new information about technology, psychology and science.
            <br><br>
