# Hey mate, what is this?

ðŸ˜ŽðŸ¤”ðŸ¤“

This is my website, I'm working on it when I don't have anything better to do. Nothing cool, easy stuff. 
This repository is mostly for me so I don't believe you'll find anything interesting here but yeah... It's there.

### Skeleton is cool

To make this whole thing responsive without stratching my muscles I'm using Skeleton. It's cool, you should check it.
Check out http://getskeleton.com for documentation and details.

### Hey mate, does it mean I can copy it?
Naaah, it's not working like that. You can clone it, have fun with it, make changes or just simply see how I've done this but
it doesn't mean you can copy&paste it under your own url.

I believe you're creative enough to came up with something new.
